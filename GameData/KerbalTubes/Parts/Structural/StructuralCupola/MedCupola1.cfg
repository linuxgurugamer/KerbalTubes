	description = Jeb, after realising the potential of a smaller, structural cupola set to work on it in his spare time between Mun excursions and "borrowing" the KSC's vast armament of fighter jets. After building the frame he realised he didn't have any windows in stock, so he snuck out back to the junkyard to salvage the windows off an old cupola he once de-orbited in, then Jeb simply had to grind the windows down and seal them into the frame.
